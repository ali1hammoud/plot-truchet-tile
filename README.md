# Truchet Tiling Generator

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Project Overview
This project implements a Python script to generate visual representations of Truchet tiles based on the ASCII binary representation of a given text string. Truchet tiles are a form of tiling where each tile has a simple pattern, which when combined, can create complex and visually appealing structures. This script takes a string, converts it into ASCII binary code, and then maps these binary sequences to specific Truchet tile patterns.
